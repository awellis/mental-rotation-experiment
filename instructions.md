During the **mental rotation blocks** (bei uns object), participants were instructed to imagine that the table rotated the distance and direction indicated by the arrow, while they remained stationary.

During the **perspective taking blocks** (bei uns egocentric), participants were instructed to imagine that the table remained stationary, while they moved around it to the tip of the arrow and looked across the center of the table from there. In both conditions, the task was to decide whether the ball would be on their left or their right after the imagined transformation.
